# Password Strength Checker

The Password Strength Checker Application is a simple, designed to help users evaluate the security strength of their passwords. This application provides instant feedback on key password criteria, guiding users to create stronger, more secure passwords that meet modern security standards.

## How It Works

The Password Strength Checker evaluates passwords based on several key security checks to ensure complexity and uniqueness. Based on reseach bad password creation has some specific predictable patterns. Each check is designed to encourage a higher level of security by identifying potential weaknesses in the password structure.

### Security Checks

1. **Length Requirement**  
   - **Check**: Password must be at least 8 characters long.  

2. **Lowercase Letters**  
   - **Check**: Password must include at least one lowercase letter (`a-z`).  

3. **Uppercase Letters**  
   - **Check**: Password must contain at least one uppercase letter (`A-Z`).  

4. **Numbers**  
   - **Check**: Password must contain at least one numeric digit (`0-9`).  

5. **Special Characters**  
   - **Check**: Password must include at least one special character (e.g., `!@#$%^&*`).  

6. **Common Patterns**  
   - **Check**: Identifies common, easily guessed patterns, such as `"1234"`, `"password"`, `"abc"`, or `"qwerty"`.  

7. **Date Patterns**  
   - **Check**: Detects date patterns in various formats (e.g., `dd-mm-yyyy`, `mm-dd-yyyy`, `yyyymmdd`, or a standalone year).
