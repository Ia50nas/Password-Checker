# Password-Checker
The Password Strength Checker Application is a simple, user-friendly tool designed to help users evaluate the security strength of their passwords. This application provides instant feedback on key password criteria, guiding users to create stronger, more secure passwords that meet modern security standards.

The Password Strength Checker application evaluates password strength based on several key security checks. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of the checks it performs:

Length Requirement:
Check: Ensures that the password is at least 8 characters long.
Reason: Longer passwords are generally harder to crack and provide a stronger layer of security.
Lowercase Letters:

Check: Verifies that the password includes at least one lowercase letter (a-z).
Reason: Including a mix of character types (lowercase and uppercase) enhances password complexity.


Uppercase Letters:
Check: Confirms that the password contains at least one uppercase letter (A-Z).
Reason: A mix of uppercase and lowercase letters increases the difficulty of guessing the password.

Numbers:
Check: Checks that the password contains at least one numeric digit (0-9).
Reason: Adding numbers introduces further complexity, making the password more resilient to brute-force attacks.

Special Characters:
Check: Ensures the password includes at least one special character (e.g., !@#$%^&*).
Reason: Special characters are less predictable, so their inclusion strengthens the password by making it harder to guess.

Common Patterns:
Check: Looks for common patterns or easily guessable strings such as "1234", "password", "abc", or "qwerty".
Reason: Common patterns are predictable and often targeted by attackers, so avoiding them increases password security.

Date Patterns:
Check: Identifies date patterns in various formats (e.g., dd-mm-yyyy, mm-dd-yyyy, yyyymmdd, or just a year).
Reason: Dates, especially birthdates, are commonly used but easily guessed, so this check encourages users to avoid date-related patterns.
