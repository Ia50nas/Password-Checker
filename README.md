Password Strength Checker
The Password Strength Checker Application is a user-friendly tool designed to evaluate the security strength of passwords, guiding users to create robust passwords that meet modern security standards. This application provides instant feedback on key password criteria, helping users improve their password security.

How It Works
The Password Strength Checker evaluates passwords based on several key security checks to ensure complexity and uniqueness. Each check is designed to encourage a higher level of security by identifying potential weaknesses in the password structure.

Security Checks
Length Requirement

Check: Password must be at least 8 characters long.
Reason: Longer passwords are harder to crack and add a strong layer of security.
Lowercase Letters

Check: Password must include at least one lowercase letter (a-z).
Reason: Mixing character types (lowercase and uppercase) increases complexity.
Uppercase Letters

Check: Password must contain at least one uppercase letter (A-Z).
Reason: A combination of uppercase and lowercase letters makes passwords more challenging to guess.
Numbers

Check: Password must contain at least one numeric digit (0-9).
Reason: Adding numbers introduces complexity, strengthening the password against brute-force attacks.
Special Characters

Check: Password must include at least one special character (e.g., !@#$%^&*).
Reason: Special characters make the password less predictable and harder to guess.
Common Patterns

Check: Identifies common, easily guessed patterns, such as "1234", "password", "abc", or "qwerty".
Reason: Predictable patterns are often targeted by attackers, so avoiding them increases security.
Date Patterns

Check: Detects date patterns in various formats (e.g., dd-mm-yyyy, mm-dd-yyyy, yyyymmdd, or a standalone year).
Reason: Dates, especially birthdates, are often used and easily guessed, so this check encourages users to avoid date-related patterns.
